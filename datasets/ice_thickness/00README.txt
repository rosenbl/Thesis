AMSRIce03 Sea Ice Thickness Data

DATA ORGANIZATION
The data files are available on NSIDC's FTP site:

ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/pub/DATASETS/AVDM/data/cryosphere/AMSRIce03/ground_data/ice_thickness/

DOWNLOADING DATA VIA FTP
You may download data via your FTP program of choice. Our FTP server 
allows you to download a recursive set of directories with a single 
FTP command (tar-on-the-fly), simply by appending the .tar extension 
to a directory name in the FTP get command. 

For example, using a command-line FTP program, you can download all of 
the sea ice thickness data files using the following commands:

%ftp sidads.colorado.edu (login as anonymous, and use your e-mail address as 
password)
ftp> cd /pub/DATASETS/AVDM/data/cryosphere/AMSRIce03/ground_data/
    
        
ftp> get ice_thickness.tar

This command will generate a tar file on your local disk containing
everything under the subdirectory ice_thickness.

In most Web browsers, you can also use the tar-on-the-fly capability
by simply appending the .tar extension to the directory name in the
FTP address. For example, to download all the sea ice thickness data, 
enter the following FTP address in your browser's location/address field:

ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/pub/DATASETS/AVDM/data/cryosphere/AMSRIce03/ground_data/ice_thickness.tar

The browser should prompt for where to save the tar file.
